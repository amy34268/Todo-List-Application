# My Personal Project

## todo list


The project I choose is **Todo List**, the application can help people keep track of things, either completed or to be completed.
it will include features such as adding and deleting tasks.

People such as business professionals or students would likely find this application helpful as they 
have to keep track of tasks and deadlines.

I choose this to do this project because I personally benefited from the useful functions todo list offer which
keep me updated of school work.I am interested to learn the logic of how such an application is built.
